    <p>I'm a junior at BYU-I studying Audio Engineering. <br>
        When I'm not playing, recording, or mixing music, I like to spend time studying Japanese or playing video games.</p>
    <p>I'm taking this class because I hope to work freelance after school, and having a website to help advertise and compile a portfolio 
        seems like a really good idea to me.</p>
    <p>I don't really have a lot to say about myself but I'm not a closed book. You just have to ask. But try not to. </p>
