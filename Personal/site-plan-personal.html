      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I will be creating a website that will serve as both a portfolio and an advertisement for me and my career. I work as a composer/arranger, performer, and audio engineer and having one location visible to everyone that showcases all of my skills will allow for potential customers to hire me quicker and easier.<br>
      My sub pages will be where my portfolio of sorts will be located and/or linked to. One for music based projects, and one for film based projects.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        BIO <br>
        My name is Michael Michelsen. I am an audio engineer who specializes in recording and post production. I've worked as a 
        location sound engineer for several productions ranging from 30 second advertisements to full length TV episodes, and as a post 
        production engineer for projects such as my own album, audiobooks, and even a jazz trio hosted at BYU-Idaho. <br>

        I also work as a musician specializing in jazz performance, and a composer specializing in video game music. <br>

        I was born and raised in Montana and started playing music from a young age. A couple years later I started learning 
        trumpet for school and soon grew to love the combination of both listening and playing those instruments. Ever since then I 
        have expanded my abilities, learning how to play bass, tenor saxophone, and even taking lessons for the harp. <br>

        WHAT I DO
        In 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, I discovered a love for mixing music just as much as playing, if not even more so. 
        Having studied jazz I had to train my ears to listen closely to music, which in turn helped my ability to mix. 
        “A good audio engineer has a good ear.” <br>

        WHY PICK ME
        After getting certified in Pro Tools, the Lawo mc Broadcast Console and Dante Networking, I was granted the opportunity to work 
        in a studio during my time as a student. Despite having an emphasis in music I was able to expand my abilities as an audio engineer 
        with film productions, voice over recordings, sports broadcasts, and so much more. <br>

        Now based in Idaho, I am available to hire for your composition, performance, recording, or post production needs! <br>
