                <div class="para-header">What are your certifications?</div><br>
                I am certified in: <br>
                Pro Tools 110 <br>
                Dante level 2 <br> 
                Lawo mc<sup>2</sup>56 Console <br>
                <br>
                <div class="para-header">Are you available for my project?</div><br>
                I am currently employed by Cardboard Forge Pictures as their location sound engineer 
                and as a broadcast/post-production engineer at my university, but if I'm not on set with 
                them I have plenty of time to work on your project as well. <br>
                <br>
                <div class="para-header">How much do your services cost?</div><br>
                As a general guideline I charge around $40/hour for most projects.
                However there are several factors involved such as how big is the project, how soon it needs 
                to be done, or even are you a student. <br>
                So feel free to reach out to determine a set price.
